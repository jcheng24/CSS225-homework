#Description of what the program does: two parts with a list, a. separate in different line, then b. square each number in the list
#
#Description of know issues: none?


num_list = ('12','10','32','3','66','17','42','99','20')

#part A
#separates the numbers in different lines
print(*num_list, sep='\n')


#part B
#sqaure the numbers in the list
print(12**2)
print(10**2)
print(32**2)
print(3**2)
print(66**2)
print(17**2)
print(42**2)
print(99**2)
print(20**2)


#I know how to do a list and separate them in different lines then I know how
#sqaure numbers by doing each number individually, but I don't know how to do a
#shortcut way of just using num_list and square them.
